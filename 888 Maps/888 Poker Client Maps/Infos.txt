The 3 .exe executables are to handle any popups. Are built with autoit, and you can edit them even with notepad++ if you dont have autoit installed.
It can be annoying when you try to rebuy, cause the script will auto close the rebuy window, so to avoid that, deactivate them, do the rebuy/addon and then activate them again.
